# glove-vs-bow
Training neural models for sentiment analysis with Glove representation and BoW representations for reviews of toys.

Coded for CSE 597 NLP class homework. Due to the small dataset, the models do not get a great accuracy (~70%) in terms of accuracy. Meant more as a practice for understanding how different word embeddings have an effect on the results of the classifier.

Note: Very sensitive to the environment. Please refer to the pdf instructions for the specific environment
